# 🍷 Clustering Assignment – Wine Dataset

## 📌 Objective
This project performs a comparative analysis of clustering algorithms using various preprocessing techniques and cluster counts, evaluated on multiple metrics.

## 📚 Dataset
**Wine Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine):
- 178 instances
- 13 continuous features (e.g., alcohol, magnesium, flavanoids)
- 3 actual wine classes (used only for evaluation)

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Techniques
- **Raw Data** (no preprocessing)
- **Standardization** (Z-score scaling)
- **Normalization** (Min-Max scaling)
- **PCA** used for 2D visualizations

## 🧠 Clustering Algorithms
- **K-Means**
- **DBSCAN**
- **Agglomerative Clustering**

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- **Silhouette Score** (higher = better)
- **Davies-Bouldin Index** (lower = better)
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index** (higher = better)

## 🔢 Number of Clusters
- Evaluated with 2 to 5 clusters (where applicable)
